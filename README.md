Write a program that generates a random set of 8 addition problems (intended for a child in elementary school). 
Numbers to be added should be randomly chosen from the range 1..99. Each run of the program should result in a
different set of problems (actually, there is a tiny probablity that two runs of the program will produce the same
set of problems, but I donâ€™t expect anyone will encounter this). Console output should be formatted like well organize 
16 different adding operations.

A Hint is provided in the folder that accompanies this assignment, in this directory.
